# hello-world
Learning all about Github, programming, HTML/CSS 
This is all new and foreign to me right now but I'm commited to learning even at my advanced age of 74...hah! I want to learn HTML/CSS so I can build beautiful web pages and maybe make some extra money to supplement my measly SS income.
